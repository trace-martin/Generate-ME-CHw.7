  ## Description:

  Thank you for visiting my repo! <br>
  This repo can be used to generate a README file that contains all the necessary qualifications for a high-quality README. This project uses node.js and javaScript to write, style, and create the README with simple terminal prompts.
  <br>
  I struggled with the initial set up of the project but after continuously working through each function was able to create a solid project. Please enjoy!
